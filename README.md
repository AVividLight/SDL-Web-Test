# SDL-Web-Test

The intention here is to learn about WebAssembly as a platform. Additionally, I'll explore SDL3 (or two, depending on support for WASM), and electron. I'll try to use JavaScript where it makes sense for UI. All developent will take place inside a Docker container for maximum compatability.

## Setup

Configure CMake with:

```bash
cmake -S ./demo -B ./build
```

Compile with:

```bash
cmake --build ./build
```
